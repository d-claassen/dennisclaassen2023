## Releases

Releases are automatically created via GitHub Actions whenever a milestone is closed.
All pull requests need to be attached to a milestone when closed.
The pull requests can use different labels to end up in a specific section of the changelog.
The changelog will contain the following sections, with matching labels:

| Title                                            | Label                                  |

| ":lady_beetle: Bug Fixes"                        | "regression" or "bug"                  |
